# TrackItAll
CS 193P Final Project Flynn Traeger

This project was entirely devised and written by me as the culmination of a quarter's work on iOS apps working in Swift UI.

The concept of the project is a generic 'tracker' app that allows you to create categories to track anything you want all within one app.

Tracking your sleep, meals, moods, workouts, and more can all be done in one place as Track It All lets you create a category for anything you want to track and lets you define what metrics you want to measure whenever you add a new entry.
Once you've created a new category and its corresponding template for each new entry, you can hop into the app at anytime and add a new entry for whatever you want to track.

You can look back on previous entries you've made and see trends over time and reflect on any changes you've made or even just your consistency. Your data lives in-app and on your device; it is not kept externally.
